Value Exchange App (C#)

This C# application is a prototype that needs to simulate a bank exchange value system. It allows users to exchange values through a simple interface, ensuring that transactions are processed seamlessly. The app allows the user to select the wanted.

Quick Note: The app doesn't use a SQL database for saving the values but a txt, but there is a databse for saving the previous changes, helping in creating that appealing chart.

Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the app for your specific use case.
